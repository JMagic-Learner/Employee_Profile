## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Employee_Profile.
              
Description:
This application attempts to demonstrate two concepts. The first is to generate a HTML file that will display prompts given via Inquirer NPM. The second is using testing architecture to show that the values in Manager, Intern, etc are passing values through constructors / classes/ and other extensions. This project demonstrates usage of require, and export modules.             
          
Coding Process
Step by step trial and error. You will see in the output folder, numerous "Renditions" that show the HTML variations I attempted. Step by step process is absolutely neccesary, especially when you are attempting to code while doing full time employement. The first process was designing the tests required. The second is designing the constructors and extensions/requirements to pass values through. After rudimentary testing is done, we focus on passing values through require into the index, to render via FS WriteFile into the designated output folder

This application is purely to test the knowledge of the student. This homework was ridiculous.
